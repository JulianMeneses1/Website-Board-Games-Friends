                        to organize and share your available days and hours to play with your friends. You will easily and efficiently 
                        synchronize your calendar and those of the other players to find out what day and time everyone is available to play. This would 
                        significantly expedite the matter of coordination due to the difficulties that each one has when trying to find a free spot in their daily schedule.

                        With this last stretch goal, we will extend this beautiful gaming activity to more players, by translating the app to Spanish, 
                        French, German and Chinese. Jumping the language barrier can help to create new bonds of friendship, 
                        spread the board game culture and unite the gaming community even more.

                        Because all board gamers and people who don't play yet should have the opportunity to share great moments.</p>
