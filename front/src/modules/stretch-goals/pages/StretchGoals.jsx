                    Fulfilling this goal would bring a new functionality to the app, enabling you 
                    to organize and share your available days and hours to play with your friends. You will easily and efficiently 
                    synchronize your calendar and those of the other players to find out what day and time everyone is available to play. This would 
                    significantly expedite the matter of coordination due to the difficulties that each one has when trying to find a free spot in their d
                    aily schedule.

<h3>APP barrierless</h3>
<p>With this last stretch goal, we will extend this beautiful gaming activity to more players, by translating the app to Spanish, French, German and Chinese. Jumping the language barrier can help to create new bonds of friendship, spread the board game culture and unite the gaming community even more.</p>

<h3>We think bigger!</h3>
<p>We want to grow with the community so our future plans will include improvements and new sections to the app. So all of us can find and join board games events, competitions, personalize sections for board gamers clubs, stores and much more!
And of course we want the Board Games Friends app to be free forever!
We can make this together!
Our main goal is to create an app that fulfils the expectations of the board gamers.
As we are board game lovers and players as well, this project aims for continuous expansion, reaching as many countries as possible. Because all board gamers and people who don't play yet should have the opportunity to share great moments.
