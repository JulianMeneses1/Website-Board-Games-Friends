                <h5>The app designers </h5>
                <p>
                    We are an Argentinian couple living in Australia. Our professions are social communicator and UX
                    UI designer (Naty) and physicist (Fer). We have travelled and played board games in many
                    countries. We have also lived in New York city and we are currently enjoying Melbourne.
                    By the time we arrived in Manhattan we faced the difficulties of finding regular groups to play
                    our passion. We used many apps and gathered in many places, enjoying the company of many
                    great players and board game designers, but at first it wasn't so easy.
                    Then we realized that if we had a space where the community could join and offer their places
                    in a space specially prepared for us, an app that shows only what we want to see, that would be
                    amazing!
                    So we decided to design and create Board Games Friends, just for our community, with love and
                    understanding of the things we care about regarding board games.
                    Just a gift for all who enjoy spending time playing and meeting with friends.
