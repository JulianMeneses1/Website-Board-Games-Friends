                        You will be able to navigate some sections of the Board Game Friends App, exploring some of their options. 
                        The UX/UI design has a complex interconnectivity between buttons, screens, and functions, as you can see in the ‚ÄúA UX/UI experience‚Äù
                        section on this webpage, where a short video displays more than 300 interconnected screens.

                    <p>
                        This demo is a reduced and adapted circuit of that design, serving as a preview of what the fully developed app will look like.
