                    <h5  className="fs-5"><b>Why don't you offer some merchandising in the rewards? </b></h5>
                    <p>For now, we think it is important to focus on the app development and avoid getting involved with merchandising, 
                        because we don’t have experience in that field, and we know it may incur unexpected expenses and times 
                        that put the project in risk (such as production, logistics or shipping processes). We want to promise things 
                        that we can do. Maybe in future stages we can explore merchandising options to raise money and continue with 
                        this wonderful community project.</p>

                    <h5  className="fs-5"><b>Will you translate the app to more languages? </b></h5>
                    <p>As our primary goal, we planned and designed the app in English. Once we achieve that, we will strive to fulfill the third stretch goal, 
                        where we commit to translating the app into Spanish, French and German. This is quite a challenge as each language 
                        has its own peculiarities that need to be adjusted to the app's interface design. We are really looking forward to 
                        including as many languages as possible, because we believe that having an app that allows us to gather and enjoy board games 
                        in many countries will further strengthen the community.</p>
                        
                    <h5  className="fs-5"><b> When will the app be ready? </b></h5>
                    <p>The journey towards launching the BGF app will involve several important milestones. In May, we celebrated the completion of the prototype design, 
                        marking a significant step forward in the development process. As we approached June, our focus shifted to preparing for the Kickstarter campaign, 
                        ensuring that all elements were meticulously arranged for a successful launch. Finally, in September, the Kickstarter campaign is taking off, 
                        engaging backers and potential users in our project.</p>
                    <p>With the necessary funds secured, we plan to embark on the development process in October, dedicating our efforts to transform the prototype into a 
                        fully functional app. By late November, we intend to do the first round of testing updates, refining the app based on user feedback and 
                        addressing any issues encountered. In December, we will reach an exciting stage as “BGF Supportive Friend”, “BGF Remarkable Friend” and 
                        “BGF Extraordinary Friend” supporters will be able to participate in an online team meeting and in beta testing, offering invaluable insights to 
                        further enhance the app's performance.</p>
                    <p>Thorough testing and meticulous error-checking will come in January, to ensure the app's stability and functionality. Finally, in February, we expect the app will be ready for download, 
                        fulfilling our long-awaited goal.</p>
                    <p>After that, we will continuously check for updates, bug fixes and additional enhancements.</p> 

                    <h5 className="fs-5"><b>How do you plan to sustain the BGF app in the future?</b></h5>
                    <p>Our mission is to give this platform to board game players for free. We don’t look for any profit, 
                        we just love sharing board games with the community. As this project is in an early stage, we are 
                        using our personal names for this crowdfunding campaign, but we plan to transition to a non-profit organization in the 
                        future. This will provide an opportunity to receive both public and private donations, as well as sell merchandise such as pins, keyrings, and stickers, 
                        in order to collect additional funds and ensure the ongoing operation of the app, including cloud 
                        storage services and development improvements. </p>

                    <h5  className="fs-5"><b>Can I pledge outside Australia?</b></h5>
                    <p>Yes, you can pledge worldwide! BGF app is intended to work in every place 
                        as long as there are people to play. We really encourage people from different 
                        places and cultures to join the project, 
                        that will make the board game network more diverse and full of opportunities. Please, read the full guide for multiple ways of pay options

                    <h5 className="fs-5"><b>Can I back multiple rewards levels?</b></h5>
                    <p>Unfortunately, Kickstarter only allows backers to support 1 reward level. However, upon selecting your desired pledge, 
                        you will discover that each tier includes not only its own reward but also the benefits from preceding levels.</p>

                    <h5  className="fs-5"><b>I don't have a credit card, is there a way to back this project?</b></h5>

                    <h5  className="fs-5"><b>Why is it important to participate in an online team meeting?</b></h5>
                    <p>If you pledge for “BGF Supportive Friend”, “BGF Remarkable Friend” and “BGF Extraordinary Friend” tiers, 
                        you will have the opportunity to participate in an online team meeting with the creators and the developers. 
                        Taking part in the meeting and suggesting ideas to improve the app is essential for several reasons.</p>
                    <p>Firstly, it provides an opportunity to contribute with fresh perspectives as different backers would bring 
                        diverse backgrounds, expertise, and experiences to the table.  </p>
                    <p>Secondly, this meeting will allow for constructive discussions and feedback, helping to refine and enhance the initial 
                        concepts of the app. By actively participating, the beta testers can raise concerns, ask questions and offer suggestions, 
                        thereby ensuring a comprehensive 
                        evaluation of the app's potential improvements. This collective involvement will lead to a stronger sense of ownership and 
                        commitment to the project's success.</p>
                    <p>Ultimately, participating in a team meeting to suggest ideas for app improvement cultivates 
                        an environment of collaboration, continuous learning, and innovation, resulting in a more refined and user-centric app. </p>
                    
                    <h5 className="fs-5"><b>Why do you need beta testers and how does it work?</b></h5>
                    <p>Beta testing is a crucial step in the app development, it enables the developers to evaluate the Board Games 
                        Friends progress by obtaining valuable insights regarding its features and modifications by the targeted group of users' 
                        suggestions. Throughout the beta testing phase, we will address any issues or glitches 
                        identified by the beta testers and gather their input about the app's modifications.</p>
                    <p>If you pledged for either the “BGF Maker” or “BGF Gold Friend” tiers, which include beta testing, 
                        you will receive an invitation to your email by the software development company with a link to 
                        install and use the beta version of the application on your mobile phone. 
                        Your use experience feedback will be very important because it will empower the developers to 
                        enhance and bring a more satisfactory app for the users. </p>
                    
                    <h5 className="fs-5"><b>How will I get access to the app once it is launched?</b></h5>
                    <p>Once the BGF mobile app is released to the public, you will be able to download 
                        it from the App Store for <b>IOS</b> devices or Google Play Store for <b>Android</b>. Yay!</p>
